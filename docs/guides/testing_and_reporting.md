# Testing and Reporting Guide for NVIDIA Dynamo

This guide describes best practices for testing and reporting in the NVIDIA Dynamo project to ensure high quality and maintainability.

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Tests

- Unit tests: Cover individual functions and modules.
- Integration tests: Validate interactions between components.
- Deployment tests: Verify Helm chart installation, upgrade, scaling, failure recovery, and load/performance.
- End-to-end tests: Simulate real user scenarios and workflows.

### Test Execution

- Run tests locally using `pytest`.
- CI pipelines automatically run tests on pull requests and merges.
- Use test markers to categorize tests (e.g., `@pytest.mark.slow`, `@pytest.mark.e2e`).

### Test Coverage

- Aim for high coverage across all code paths.
- Include edge cases and error handling scenarios.
- Regularly review and update tests as code evolves.

## Reporting

### Test Reports

- CI pipelines generate test reports with pass/fail status.
- Use coverage reports to identify untested code.
- Review test failures promptly and address root causes.

### Bug Reporting

- Document bugs with clear reproduction steps.
- Include logs, screenshots, and test case references.
- Prioritize bugs based on impact and severity.

## Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review test effectiveness.
- Refactor tests to improve readability and maintainability.
- Incorporate feedback from users and developers.

## Tools and Resources

- `pytest` for test execution.
- Coverage tools like `coverage.py`.
- CI platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- Kubernetes and Helm for deployment testing.

## Conclusion

Consistent testing and thorough reporting are critical to maintaining NVIDIA Dynamo's reliability and performance. Follow this guide to contribute effectively to the project's quality assurance efforts.
